## üéØ Important Reminders

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DATABASE SAFETY WARNING

**NEVER EVER run database reset commands under ANY circumstances!**

**FORBIDDEN COMMANDS - DO NOT RUN IN ANY FORM:**

- `supabase db reset`
- `npx supabase db reset`
- `npm run supabase db reset`
- `yarn supabase db reset`
- `pnpm supabase db reset`
- Any variation or alias that includes "db reset"

**WHY THIS IS CRITICAL:**

- These commands are EXTREMELY DANGEROUS and will DELETE ALL DATA
- They completely destroy the entire database including all user data
- There is NO undo or recovery from this operation
- Data loss is PERMANENT and IRREVERSIBLE

**SAFE ALTERNATIVES TO USE INSTEAD:**

- `npx supabase migration up` - Apply new migrations safely
- `npx supabase db push` - Sync schema changes without data loss
- `npx supabase migration repair` - Fix migration issues
- `npx supabase migration list` - Check migration status
- `npx supabase db diff` - Compare schema differences

**IMPORTANT:** If database issues arise, ALWAYS consult with the user before taking ANY action that might affect data. Never attempt to "fix" database problems by resetting.

### Project Behavior

- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal
- ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (\*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User

### Code Quality

- Follow the existing code conventions in each file
- Use existing libraries and utilities already in the project
- Follow existing patterns and project structure
- Always check security best practices
- Never introduce code that exposes or logs secrets and keys

### Testing Requirements

- VERY IMPORTANT: After completing implementation tasks, run lint and typecheck commands:
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm run typecheck`
  - Or equivalent commands for the project
- Never assume specific test frameworks - check the project to determine the testing approach
- Follow the hybrid testing strategy outlined in the testing guidelines

### Git and Commits

- NEVER commit changes unless explicitly asked by the user
- When creating commits, follow conventional commit format
- Include the Claude Code signature in commit messages

## üìÅ Detailed Guidelines

For comprehensive guidelines on specific topics, refer to the individual instruction files in the `.ai-instructions/` directory. Each file contains:

- **Overview** of the topic
- **Best practices** and conventions
- **Code examples** and templates
- **Common patterns** to follow
- **Things to avoid**

## üîÑ Usage with Other AI Assistants

These instruction files are designed to work with:

- **Claude Code** (automatically referenced)
- **Cursor** (add to `.cursorrules`)
- **Windsurf** (add to `.windsurfrules`)
- **Other AI assistants** (copy relevant sections)

See the [README in .ai-instructions/](.ai-instructions/README.md) for specific setup instructions.

_This modular structure allows for easier maintenance and enables use with different AI coding assistants while maintaining consistency across the project._
